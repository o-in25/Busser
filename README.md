An app for home bar management, now hosted on Fly! https://busser.fly.dev/


### Setting Up Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
For local development, service account credentials are required to authenticate with the [Cloud SQL Auth Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-auth-proxy#troubleshooting). If you already have the service account JSON locally, you can set it as the default credential by running `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=service-account.json`. Otherwise, they will be created with `gcloud auth login`.

You can then start the proxy client with with  `./cloud-sql-proxy $INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME --health-check`.

These steps will eventually (maybe) make it into the Dockerfile.


### Running the app
Start the Vite build by running `pnpm run dev`

### Deploying to Fly
To deploy to [Fly](fly.io), run `fly deploy --build-arg APP_SECRET_1=$APP_SECRET_1 APP_SECRET_2=$APP_SECRET_2 ... ` command with the relevant app keys/secrets.

Remotely access the deployed machine with `flyctl ssh console -a $APP_NAME`.
