		This Cookie Policy explains how Busser ("Company," "we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and
		similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at
		<a href="https://busserapp.com" class="text-primary hover:underline">https://busserapp.com</a>
		("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights
		to control our use of them.
	</p>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal
		information if we combine it with other information.

	<!-- What are cookies? -->
	<h2 id="what-are-cookies" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What are cookies?</h2>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you
		visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites
		work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
	</p>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Busser) are called "first-party cookies."
		Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies."
		Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or
		through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties
		that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
		website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
	</p>

	<!-- Why do we use cookies? -->
	<h2 id="why-cookies" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Why do we use cookies?</h2>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
		technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential"
		or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
		interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties
		serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is
		described in more detail below.
	</p>

	<!-- How can I control cookies? -->
	<h2 id="control-cookies" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">How can I control cookies?</h2>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your
		cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent
		Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
		cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
	</p>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our Website. If
		you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website though your access to some
		functionality and areas of our Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web
		browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
	</p>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and the
		purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific
		cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):

	<!-- What about other tracking technologies? -->
	<h2 id="other-tracking" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
		What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
	</h2>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other,
		similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels"
		or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that
		enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including
		them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
		within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether
		you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party
		website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing
		campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
		properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
	</p>

	<!-- Flash cookies -->
	<h2 id="flash-cookies" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
		Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
	</h2>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or
		"LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our
		services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.
	</p>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of
		your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the
		<a

			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer"

		>
		and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how
		to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent
		Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player
		8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page
		you are on at the time).
	</p>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies
		may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially,
		Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.

		Do you serve targeted advertising?
	</h2>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising
		through our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other
		websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may
		be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness
		of advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect
		information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant
		advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information
		collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact
		details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
