		Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a

		automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
		tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
		a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
	</p>

	<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
		California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because
